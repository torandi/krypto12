helga spake never shall i weep therefor quoth she ye have evilly beguiled me and gunnlaug has surely come out and therewith she wept much

but a little after gunnlaugs coming was bruited about and helga became so hard with raven that he could not keep her at home at mossfell so that back they had to go to burg and raven got small share of her company

now men get ready for the winterwedding thorkel of skaney bade illugi the black and his sons but when master illugi got ready gunnlaug sat in the hall and stirred not to go illugi went up to him and said why dost thou not get ready kinsman

gunnlaug answered i have no mind to go

says illugi nay but certes thou shalt go kinsman says he and cast thou not grief over thee by yearning for one woman make as if thou knewest nought of it for women thou wilt never lack

now gunnlaug did as his father bade him so they came to the wedding and illugi and his sons were set down in the high seat but thorstein egilson and raven his soninlaw and the bridegrooms following were set in the other high seat over against illugi

the women sat on the dais and helga the fair sat next to the bride oft she turned her eyes on gunnlaug thereby proving the saw eyes will betray if maid love man

gunnlaug was well arrayed and had on him that goodly raiment that king sigtrygg had given him and now he was thought far above all other men because of the many things both strength and goodliness and growth

there was little mirth among folk at this wedding but on the day when all men were making ready to go away the women stood up and got ready to go home then went gunnlaug to talk to helga and long they talked together but gunnlaug sang

    lightheart lived the wormtongue
    all day long no longer
    in mountainhome since helga
    had name of wife of raven
    nought foresaw thy father
    hardener white of fightthaw
    what my words should come to
    the maid to gold was wedded

and again he sang

    worst reward i owe them
    father thine o winemay
    and mother that they made thee
    so fair beneath thy maidgear
    for thou sweet field of seaflame
    all joy hast slain within me
    lo here take it loveliest
    eer made of lord and lady

and therewith gunnlaug gave helga the cloak ethelreds gift which was the fairest of things and she thanked him well for the gift

then gunnlaug went out and by that time ridinghorses had been brought home and saddled and among them were many very good ones and they were all tied up in the road gunnlaug leaps on to a horse and rides a handgallop along the homefield up to a place where raven happened to stand just before him and raven had to draw out of his way then gunnlaug said

    no need to slink aback raven for i threaten thee nought as at this time but thou knowest forsooth what thou hast earned

raven answered and sang

    god of woundflames glitter
    glorier of fightgoddess
    must we fall afighting
    for fairest kirtlebearer
    deathstaff many suchlike
    fair as she is are there
    in southlands oer the seafloods
    sooth saith he who knoweth

maybe there are many such but they do not seem so to me said gunnlaug

therewith illugi and thorstein ran up to them and would not have them fight

then gunnlaug sang

    the fairhued golden goddess
    for gold to raven sold they
    raven my match as men say
    while the mighty isleking
    ethelred in england
    from eastward way delayed me
    wherefore to goldwaster
    waneth tongues speechhunger

hereafter both rode home and all was quiet and tidingless that winter through but raven had nought of helgas fellowship after her meeting with gunnlaug
chapter fourteen  of the holmgang at the althing

now in summer men ride a very many to the althing illugi the black and his sons with him gunnlaug and hermund thorstein egilson and kolsvein his son onund of mossfell and his sons all and sverting hafrbiorns son skapti yet held the spokesmanshipatlaw

one day at the thing as men went thronging to the hill of laws and when the matters of the law were done there then gunnlaug craved silence and said

is raven the son of onund here

he said he was

then spake gunnlaug thou well knowest that thou hast got to wife my avowed bride and thus hast thou made thyself my foe now for this i bid thee to holm here at the thing in the holm of the axewater when three nights are gone by

raven answers this is well bidden as was to be looked for of thee and for this i am ready whenever thou willest it

now the kin of each deemed this a very ill thing but at that time it was lawful for him who thought himself wronged by another to call him to fight on the holm

so when three nights had gone by they got ready for the holmgang and illugi the black followed his son thither with a great following but skapti the lawman followed raven and his father and other kinsmen of his

now before gunnlaug went upon the holm he sang

    out to isle of eelfield
    dight am i to hie me
    give o god thy singer with glaive to end the striving
    here shall i the head cleave
    of helgas loves devourer
    at last my bright sword bringeth
    sundering of head and body

then raven answered and sang

    thou singer knowest not surely
    which of us twain shall gain it
    with edge for legswathe eager
    here are the woundscythes bare now
    in whatsowise we wound us
    the tidings from the thing here
    and fame of thanes fair doings
    the fair young maid shall hear it

hermund held shield for his brother gunnlaug but sverting hafrbiorns son was ravens shieldbearer whoso should be wounded was to ransom himself from the holm with three marks of silver

now ravens part it was to deal the first blow as he was the challenged man he hewed at the upper part of gunnlaugs shield and the sword brake asunder just beneath the hilt with so great might he smote but the point of the sword flew up from the shield and struck gunnlaugs cheek whereby he got just grazed with that their fathers ran in between them and many other men

now said gunnlaug i call raven overcome as he is weaponless

but i say that thou art vanquished since thou art wounded said raven

now gunnlaug was nigh mad and very wrathful and said it was not tried out yet

illugi his father said they should try no more for that time

gunnlaug said beyond all things i desire that i might in such wise meet raven again that thou father wert not anight to part us

and thereat they parted for that time and all men went back to their booths

but on the second day after this it was made law in the lawcourt that henceforth all holmgangs should be forbidden and this was done by the counsel of all the wisest men that were at the thing and there indeed were all the men of most counsel in the land and this was the last holmgang fought in iceland this wherein gunnlaug and raven fought

but this thing was the third most thronged thing that has been held in iceland the first was after njals burning the second after the heathslaughters

now one morning as the brothers hermund and gunnlaug went to axewater to wash on the other side went many women towards the river and in that company was helga the fair then said hermund

dost thou see thy friend helga there on the other side of the river

surely i see her says gunnlaug and withal he sang

    born was she for mens bickering
    sore bale hath wrought the warstem
    and i yearned every madly
    to hold that oaktree golden
    to me then me destroyer
    of swanmeads flame uneedful
    this looking on the darkeyed
    this golden lands beholding

therewith the crossed the river and helga and gunnlaug spake awhile together and as the brothers crossed the river eastward back again helga stood and gazed long after gunnlaug

then gunnlaug looked back and sang

    moon of linenlapped one
    leekseabearing goddess
    hawkkeen out of heaven
    shone all bright upon me
    but that eyelids moonbeam
    of goldnecklaced goddess
    her hath all undoing
    wrought and me made nought of

chapter fifteen  how gunnlaug and raven agreed to go east to norway to try the matter again

now after these things were gone by men rode home from the thing and gunnlaug dwelt at home at gilsbank

on a morning when he awoke all men had risen up but he alone still lay abed he lay in a shutbed behind the seats now into the hall came twelve men all full armed and who should be there but raven onunds son gunnlaug sprang up forthwith and got to his weapons

but raven spake thou art in risk of no hurt this time quoth he but my errand hither is what thou shalt now hear thou didst call me to a holmgang last summer at the althing and thou didst not deem matters to be fairly tried therein now i will offer thee this that we both fare away from iceland and go abroad next summer and go on holm in norway for there our kinsmen are not like to stand in our way

gunnlaug answered hail to thy words stoutest of men this thine offer i take gladly and here raven mayest thou have cheer as good as thou mayest desire

it is well offered said raven but this time we shall first have to ride away thereon they parted

now the kinsmen of both sore misliked them of this but could in no wise undo it because of the wrath of gunnlaug and raven and after all that must betide that drew towards

now it is to be said of raven that he fitted out his ship in leiruvag two men are named that went with him sisters sons of his father onund one hight grim the other olaf doughty men both all the kinsmen of raven thought it great scathe when he went away but he said he had challenged gunnlaug to the holmgang because he could have no joy soever of helga and he said withal that one must fall before the other

so raven put to sea when he had wind at will and brought his ship to thrandheim and was there that winter and heard nought of gunnlaug that winter through there he abode him the summer following and still another winter was he in thrandheim at a place called lifangr

gunnlaug wormtongue took ship with hallfred troublousskald in the north at the plain they were very late ready for sea

they sailed into the main when they had a fair wind and made orkney a little before the winter earl sigurd lodverson was still lord over the isles and gunnlaug went to him and abode there that winter and the earl held him of much account

in the spring the earl would go on warfare and gunnlaug made ready to go with him and that summer they harried wide about the southisles and scotlands firths and had many fi
