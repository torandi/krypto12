used interchangeably thr_ugh_ut the

a are the necessary means t_ achiev
e the g_al.)##The Supreme L_rd said
: Karma-Samnyasa, and Karma-y_ga b_
th lead t_ the Supreme. But, _f the
 tw_, Karma-y_ga is superi_r t_ Kar
ma-Samnyasa. (5.02)##A pers_n sh_ul
d be c_nsidered a true Samnyasi _r 
renunciant wh_ neither likes n_r di
slikes. Because, free fr_m the dual
ities, ? Arjuna, _ne is easily libe
rated fr_m b_ndage. (5.03)##The ign

ne wh_ d_es all w_rk as an _ffering

)##A Karma-y_gi perf_rms acti_n by
