helga spake never shall i weep therefor quoth she ye have evilly beguiled me and gunnlaug has surely come out and therewith she wept much

but a little after gunnlaugs coming was bruited about and helga became so hard with raven that he could not keep her at home at mossfell so that back they had to go to burg and raven got small share of her company

now men get ready for the winterwedding thorkel of skaney bade illugi the black and his sons but when master illugi got ready gunnlaug sat in the hall and stirred not to go illugi went up to him and said why dost thou not get ready kinsman

gunnlaug answered i have no mind to go

says illugi nay but certes thou shalt go kinsman says he and cast thou not grief over thee by yearning for one woman make as if thou knewest nought of it for women thou wilt never lack

now gunnlaug did as his father bade him so they came to the wedding and illugi and his sons were set down in the high seat but thorstein egilson and raven his soninlaw and the bridegrooms following were set in the other high seat over against illugi

the women sat on the dais and helga the fair sat next to the bride oft she turned her eyes on gunnlaug thereby proving the saw eyes will betray if maid love man
